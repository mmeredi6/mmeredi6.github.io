      <h3> About Medli</h3>
          <p>Medli is thought to be an Australian Cattle mix, but is known to be a happy and healthy mutt.  She is eight years old and has spent much of her life in Colorado.  She has had the opportunity to explore many places in this beautful state and has made many friends along the way.</p>
      <h3>Summer of 2023</h3> 
          <p>Medli had the summer of a lifetime in 2023.  The summer was kicked off with a camping trip at Tarryall Reservior.  Camping is one of her favorite things because of the freedom to run and explore!  She starts every morning leaving the tent and walking the boundary to make sure all is well.  She occasionally gets distracted by grasshoppers and other animals in the area.  Camping always means hiking or fishing are an order, so this is a bonus to Medli.  </p>
          <p>Medli also got to spend time with some of her best friends this summer.  Kimchi the laberdoodle invited her over for a sleepover while her parents were out of town.  Kimchi has a small pool that they enjoy splashing around in on hot days. </p>
